            <p>The laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan provide the employer with a number of freedoms when rescheduling a vacation. 
                The Labor Code allows the following situations:
                <br> - 14 days or less before the start of the vacation: employer's act + employee's consent;
                <br> - More than 14 days before the start of the vacation: employee notification
                <br><br>Thus, the employer can freely adjust the number of employees on vacation according to production needs, 
                provided that all manipulations are done on time. Employees, in such a situation, are not protected from losses 
                with non-refundable tickets and tours, from disruptions of planned events and recreation.</p>
